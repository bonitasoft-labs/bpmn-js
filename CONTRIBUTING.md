# Contributing

You are here to help on `bpmn-visualization`? Awesome, feel welcome and read the following guidelines in order to know how to contribute, to ask questions and to make `bpmn-visualization` such a great tool.

All members of our community are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please make sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.

## Contributions 

There are many ways to contribute:

- help people with the questions they ask on the [Github Issues](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/issues )
- submitting bug reports and feature requests in the [Github Issues](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/issues/new )
- [writing code](CONTRIBUTING.md#code-and-documentation-changes) which can be incorporated into `bpmn-visualization` itself
- [improving](CONTRIBUTING.md#code-and-documentation-changes) the documentation
- improve the existing example applications to demonstrate features in `bpmn-visualization`

## Code and documentation changes

For all contributions, please respect the following guidelines:

1. If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, let us know in the [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/issues/new )! So we can confirm the bug or approve your feature, and provide feedback, before starting to code :slightly_smiling_face:

2. Do the changes in your own [fork](CONTRIBUTING.md#fork--create-a-branch) of the code

3. Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (eg: `.gitignore`).

4. Provide [tests](CONTRIBUTING.md#running-tests) and documentation whenever possible.

5. Be sure you have followed the [code style](CONTRIBUTING.md#code-style) for the project.

6. Prior opening a Pull Request, ensure the build is fully working by locally running `npm run all` (build, check and
test everything)

7. Open a [GitHub Pull Request](CONTRIBUTING.md#open-a-pull-request) with your patches. (**1** pull request = **1** feature or bug)
   We will review your contribution and respond as quickly as possible. Keep in mind that this is an open source project, and it may take us some time to get back to you. Your patience is very much appreciated.

8. If this is your 1st Pull Request, sign the [Contributor License Agreement](CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-the-contributor-license-agreement)

9. Be willing to accept criticism and work on improving your code. 

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on  GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)    

### Fork & create a branch

[Fork bpmn-visualization](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name. 

A good branch name would be (where issue #25 is the ticket you're working on): **25_add-annotations-to-tasks**

```sh
git checkout -b 25_annotations-to-tasks
```

### Development

Note: information about the library internals are available in the [documentation site](https://process-analytics.github.io/bpmn-visualization-js/#_architecture_and_development)

#### Requirements

- `Node.js` >= 12.x (may work with older versions but without any guarantee)
- `Typescript` 3.x
- `Supported OS` (see the Github Build workflow for more details): Windows/Linux/MacOs

#### Build

- `npm install`           *Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder*
- `npm run watch`         *Watch files in bundle and rebuild on changes* <br>
                          You can now access the project on http://localhost:10001

### Running tests 

See `package.json` for extra available scripts
- `npm run test`                *Run all tests*
- `npm run test:unit`           *Run unit tests*
- `npm run test:unit:coverage`  *Run unit tests with coverage*
- `npm run test:e2e`            *Run end-to-end tests*.

#### Debugging end-to-end tests

To see what is happening in the web browser used by the tests
- disable the `headless` mode by setting the `HEADLESS` environment variable to `false`
- set the `SLOWMO` environment variable to a positive millisecond value (between `200` and `500` should be enough). This
slows Puppeteer down by milliseconds that we specify. So we will be able to observe what it actually does.
- set the `DEBUG` environment variable with `DEBUG=test` to activate debug logs. This is activated by default when
running the npm task. Think about it when running tests in your IDE.


### Code style

Your patch should follow the same conventions & pass the same code quality checks as the rest of the project.

Project, in major line, follows the code style suggested by [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) which is explicit and well documented.

Typescript have been chosen as it's strongly typed and we believe it adds some syntactical benefits to the JavaScript language
More information here:  [Typescript](CONTRIBUTING.md#typescript) 

To enforce best practices we use ESLint and husky.
The later performs ```eslint --fix``` on pre-commit event to make sure that committed code meets standards.

ESLint configuration extends:
- plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended
- prettier/@typescript-eslint
- plugin:prettier/recommended

### Building the html documentation

**DISCLAIMER**:
- the documentation sources are in the AsciiDoctor format and are hosted in the [docs](./docs) folder. The display
may not fully work (font-awesome icons and some links) depending on the rendering engine. This is the case when
displayed directly on GitHub Web.
- the generation currently relies on `Docker`. This will change in the future.

From the root folder of the repository, run 
```bash
./docs/build-doc.bash
```

The documentation is generated in the `build/docs` folder.

### IDE - configuration

To fully benefit the ESLint and Jest testing frameworks, you must properly set up your IDE.

##### Intellij

###### [EditorConfig](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html#editorconfig)

Go to `File` -> `Settings` ( `IntelliJ IDEA` -> `Preferences` on `macOS`) and `Editor` --> `Code Style`, then tick the
`Enable EditorConfig support`


###### [ESLint](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/eslint.html#)

Go to `File` -> `Settings` and type ESLint in search box

Enable ESLint by choosing `Automatic ESLint configuration`

If automatic configuration is not working for any reason try with `Manual ESLint configuration`, specify:
- ESLint package to point to `project\node_modules\eslint`
- Configuration file must point to `project\.eslintrc.js`

You also need to set up Coding Style rules

It is as simple as doing `right-click` on the file `.eslintrc.js` and choosing option `Apply ESLint Code Style Rules`

###### [Jest tests](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-unit-tests-on-jest.html)

To be able to run tests from IntelliJ, you must set up the default Jest template in `Run/Debug Configurations`

Adjust following parameters:
- Configuration files: it depends on the type of tests you want to run 
  - unit tests: `<project_dir>/jest.config.unit.js`
  - end to end tests: `<project_dir>/jest.config.e2e.js`

###### [Debugging TypeScript code](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-and-debugging-typescript.html#ws_ts_debug_client_side_on_external_dev_server)

- create a new `JavaScript Debug` configuration as described in the [Intellij documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-and-debugging-typescript.html#ws_ts_debug_client_side_on_external_dev_server)
  - the targeted url is: http://localhost:10001/
  - use `Chrome` as browser
  - check `Ensure breakpoints are detected when loading scripts`  
- start the application in development mode by running `npm run start` or `npm run watch`
- select the `JavaScript Debug` configuration and run it with Debug Runner
- the browser opens, and debug session starts (see [Intellij documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-and-debugging-typescript.html#ws_ts_debug_client_side_on_external_dev_server)
documentation for more details) 

###### SonarLint

Additionally, it is advised to install SonarLint Plugin

It helps to avoid coding mistakes -> reduced technical debt


###### AsciiDoc

We use [asciidoc](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/) to write the documentation.

An [AsciiDoc IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc) is a helpful plugin that permits visualizing .adoc files directly in IntelliJ


### Sign the Contributor License Agreement

By signing the CLA, we acknowledge that your contribution is accepted as it and that you cannot be held responsible for
any impacts on its integration. You then grant us the right to modify and distribute your code without restrictions. We
ask this of all contributors in order to assure our users of the origin and continuing existence of the code.

When you contribute to the project on GitHub with a new pull request, the [cla-assistant bot](https://cla-assistant.io/)
will evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the bot will comment on the pull request, including a link
to this system to accept the agreement.

You only need to sign the CLA once or when the CLA terms have changed.


### Open a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's up to date with `bpmn-visualization`
`master` branch:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!

```sh
git checkout 25_annotations-to-tasks
git rebase master
git push --set-upstream origin 25_annotations-to-tasks
```

Finally, go to GitHub and [make a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) ​with labels :smile:

:warning: ​We care about quality. So your PR won't be merged until all tests pass.

### Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to [rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

Here's the suggested workflow:

```sh
git checkout 25_annotations-to-tasks
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push --force-with-lease 25_annotations-to-tasks
```



At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help. Everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:


### Typescript
Although Linting, Sonar and Tests keeps the code in a good shape
We strongly recommend you to read following resources to be able to write code that is conform to the best practices:
- [basics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)
- [do's and don'ts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/do-s-and-don-ts.html)


## Maintainers

### Merging a PR (maintainers only)

A PR can only be merged into master by a maintainer, if all of these conditions are met:

* It is passing CI.
* It has been approved by at least two maintainers. If it was a maintainer who opened the PR, only one extra approval is needed.
* It has no requested changes.
* It is up to date with current master.

### Release (maintainers only)

Maintainers need to do the manual following actions **in the order described here** to push out a release.

For automation, see [#139](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/issues/139).

#### Issues and milestones update

Milestone names are based on the lib version
- Clean the opened milestone if some issues are still opened (move them to a new one or discard milestone from them)
- Close the milestone
- Clean the [Day to Day Board](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/projects/1): archive all cards
of the `Done` column related to the milestone


#### Git Tag

- Ensures you’re on master and don’t have local, un-commited changes: `git checkout master && git pull --tags`
- Bumps the version number in package.json based on major, minor or patch (see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version, type:
 [new-version | major | minor | patch]): `npm version [type] --message "[RELEASE] %s"`
- Push to GitHub: `git push && git push --tags`

#### GitHub update

- Ensure the latest closed milestone matches the name of the tag/version that has just been pushed. Renamed it if needed
- GitHub release
  - Open [github releases](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/releases)
  - Create a new draft release and name it `Next` (the name is not relevant and will be replaced automatically later).
  This ensures that development can continue without impacting the writing of the content of the in progress release. That way,
  if a PR is merged, `release-drafter` will update the `Next` draft release keeping the in-progress release untouched.
  - The draft release for the newly tagged version should already exist:
    - [release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) creates or updates draft release for the
    next version each time a pull request is merged to the `master` branch.
    - create a new release if it is missing or rename the existing one to match .
  - Assign the new tag as release target and save the draft (this should have already been managed by `release-drafter`)
  - Ensure that `This is a pre-release` is unchecked (except if we are releasing alpha, beta, rc, ...)
  - In the release description (check previous releases as a source of inspiration)
    - at least add/update a link to the related milestone
    - put screenshots/gif of the new features
  - Published the release **only when you are done** with the release content. At any time, you can save the draft


### bpmn-visualization-examples repository update

You must create a Pull Request to integrate any changes to this repository.

#### Demo environment update
Make the new version available for demo

- the `Upload` GitHub workflow has built the demo for the new tag, so download the demo artifact directly from the
Actions section on GitHub
- alternatively, if the artifact is not available via GitHub Actions, you can build it locally
  - checkout the git tag related to the new version
  - run `npm run demo` which generates it in the `dist` folder
- create a new branch in the [bpmn-visualization-examples](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/demo)
 repository and add the new demo content (proceed how it has been done for prior versions). 
- push to GitHub and create a new Pull Request

#### Examples update
**Note**: do this using the Pull Request you have just created for the demo update

Make the examples use the latest version of the lib. A bash script is available to help you for this task in the `scripts`
folder.
Tests that the examples work with the new lib version.


#### Tagging
When all updates have been completed, merge the Pull Request created above.


To create the tag, the easiest way is to create a new release by following the [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release)
- for `Tag version`, use a value that is the same as the lib. The tag will be created when the release will be published
- for `Target`
  - usually, keep the `master` branch except if new commits that you don't want to integrate for the release are already
  available in the branch
  - in that case, choose a dedicated commit 
  - **important**: ensure that the build to pass on the chosen branch or commit used to create the release


Alternatively, you can create the tag from your local machine and then push it.
