`bpmn-visualization` is a TypeScript library to visualize process execution data on [BPMN](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/)
diagrams with
- additional display options for execution data (highlight some transitions, counters, and more)
- with interactive capacities (mouse hover, click)


**Supported Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.


# Demo and examples

## Demo

Give a try to the [__:fast_forward: demo live environment__](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/master/demo/index.html).
The demo let you load a BPMN file to see how `bpmn-visualization` renders it. Various versions of the lib are available. 

If you need BPMN examples, you can use resources from 
- the [BPMN Model Interchange Working Group (BPMN MIWG)](http://www.omgwiki.org/bpmn-miwg)
  - https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite
  - https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-demos
- [bpmn-visualization BPMN test diagrams](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/blob/master/bpmn-files/README.md)

# Roadmap

`bpmn-visualization` is in early development stages and is subject to changes prior to the `1.0.0` release.

For now, we render the most common BPMN elements. Notice that there is currently no plan to support `Conversation` and `Choreography`.

We are currently focusing on the [packaging](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/milestone/18) of the library.

Then, we will work on BPMN extensions, library extension points, display options for execution data with interactive
capacities.
