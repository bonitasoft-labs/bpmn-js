# Demos

The [demo environment](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/master/demo/index.html)
let you load a BPMN file to see how the lib renders it. Various versions of the lib are available. 

If you need BPMN examples, you can use resources of the [BPMN Model Interchange Working Group (BPMN MIWG)](http://www.omgwiki.org/bpmn-miwg)

# Roadmap

`BPMN Visualization JS` is in early development stages and is subject to changes until the `1.0.0` version is released.

We are currently focusing on the [BPMN support](https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/milestone/6)
to be able to render most of the BPMN elements.

Then, we will work on BPMN extensions, library extension points.
