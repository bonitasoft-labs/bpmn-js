== Supported BPMN Elements
:icons: font

NOTE: The short term support roadmap is available in https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-js/milestones[Github milestones]


The following presents BPMN elements that can be displayed by the lib and states which is their rendering status i.e. if
the BPMN elements are rendered with their final shapes.

The default rendering uses `white` as fill color and `black` as stroke color.

[TIP]
.Legend for rendering status
====
* icon:check-circle[] considered as stable (only minor changes may occurred)
* icon:check-circle-o[] early access (1st attempt)
* icon:flask[] experimental (subject to change)
* no status means that are arbitrary rendering is used (not following BPMNN), generally using a dedicated color to identify the shape among other
