== Introduction

`BPMN Visualization JS` is JavaScript library relying on https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/PDF[BPMN] to
visualize process execution data. It is in early development stages and is subject to changes prior to the `1.0.0`
release.

We are currently focusing on the <<supported-bpmn-elements,BPMN support>> to be able to render most of the BPMN
elements. Then, we will work on BPMN extensions, library extension points.

**Supported Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge


== Demo environment

The https://cdn.statically.io/gh/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/master/demo/index.html[demo environment]
let you load a BPMN file to see how the lib renders it. Various versions of the lib are available.

If you need BPMN examples, you can use resources of the http://www.omgwiki.org/bpmn-miwg[BPMN Model Interchange Working Group (BPMN MIWG)]
