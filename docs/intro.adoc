== Introduction

`BPMN Visualization JS` is JavaScript library relying on https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/PDF[BPMN] to
visualize process execution data. It is in early development stages and is subject to changes prior to the `1.0.0`
release.

We are currently focusing on the <<supported-bpmn-elements,BPMN support>> to be able to render most of the BPMN
elements. Then, we will work on BPMN extensions, library extension points.
