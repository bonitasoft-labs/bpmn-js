== Introduction

`bpmn-visualization` is a TypeScript library to visualize process execution data on https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/[BPMN]
diagrams. It is in early development stages and is subject to changes prior to the `1.0.0` release.

We are currently focusing on the <<supported-bpmn-elements,BPMN support>> to be able to render most of the BPMN
elements. Then, we will work on BPMN extensions, library extension points, display options for execution data with interactive
capacities.

**Supported Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
