=== Examples Live Environment

*_TODO write something like the intro we have in the examples repository_*



Goal: see `bpmn-visualization` in action, help evaluation


Give a try to the https://cdn.statically.io/gh/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/master/examples/index.html[**icon:forward[] examples live environment**] to quickly have
an overview of the `bpmn-visualization` capabilities.

more explanations here....



=== Usage

*_TODO rewrite the following (only general information, no technical details)_*

Integration: directly in an html page (probably more frequent use case is demonstration or evaluation) or in a JS/TS project/application

API documentation: use TS declaration files
For more technical details and how-to, go to the https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/[bpmn-visualization-examples]
repository.



=== BPMN Diagrams

TODO find better title

displaying the diagrams is the fundation of `bpmn-visualization`
bpmn supported elements, see below (link)



==== Navigation

*TODO improve see how diagraming lib explains that*

In addition to BPMN diagram load, `bpmn-visualization` provides various way to let you discover and navigate the diagram 

* zoom
* fit: reset/set the zoom level and eventually translate the diagram (for instance, center the diagram). This can be done at load time or at any time.
* panning: drag the diagram and move/translate it
