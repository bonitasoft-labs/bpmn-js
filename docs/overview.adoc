=== Live Examples

To see `bpmn-visualization` in action, give a try to the https://cdn.statically.io/gh/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/master/examples/index.html[**icon:forward[] examples live environment**]. +
You will quickly have an overview of the `bpmn-visualization` capabilities.


=== Usage

`bpmn-visualization` can be directly used in HTML pages or integrated in Javascript and TypeScript applications. It is distributed as a https://npmjs.org/package/bpmn-visualization:[npm package]
in various bundle formats.

The API documentation is provided directly in the package thanks to the TypeScript declaration files that can used in IDE for code assist.

For more technical details and how-to, go to the https://github.com/process-analytics/bpmn-visualization-examples/[bpmn-visualization-examples]
repository.


=== BPMN Diagrams

https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/[BPMN diagrams] are at the foundation of the `bpmn-visualization` capabilities.

Go to <<supported-bpmn-elements, Supported BPMN Elements>> section to better now what is the current BPMN support.

==== Diagram Display

The first goal of `bpmn-visualization` is to display BPMN diagrams but this is up to the integration (i.e. the application that uses it) to provide the BPMN diagram
content.  +
For instance, it can be retrieved from a local file, by pulling a REST API, made available after a push from websockets or SSE, ...

Once the integration gets the BPMN diagram input source, it just has to pass it to `bpmn-visualization` which is then in charge of rendering the diagram.


==== Diagram Navigation

In addition to rendering, `bpmn-visualization` provides various ways to let you discover and navigate through the BPMN diagrams.
This is made available at load time or at runtime, through user interactions or API calls.

The navigation features are:

* zoom: change the diagram scale to show details or have an overview of the diagram.
* fit: reset/set the zoom level and eventually translate the diagram (for instance, center the diagram).
* panning: drag the diagram and move/translate it, to hidden parts or change the position in the view.


Navigation is particularly useful for large diagrams. In that case, fitting the view provides a good overview, but it can be hard to see some details. +
You need to zoom to highlight specific parts, then panning helps you to view different diagram portions. +
Finally, after navigating in various area, you may want to reset the zoom level and have a diagram overview.
