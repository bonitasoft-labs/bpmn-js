=== mxGraph Integration

The https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/[mxGraph] integration is in charge of displaying the BPMN diagrams, by filling the
https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/manual.html#3.1.1:[mxGraph model] from the BPMN model and the mxGraph BPMN styles.

The lib defines the mxGraph BPMN styles and associates them to the right render, using dedicated BPMN mxGraph shapes.
For more technical details, see the <<bpmn-support-howto-elements-rendering,BPMN Elements rendering>>

==== BPMN elements positioning

*WIP*
Apply to both BPMN shapes and edges

* mxGraph coordinates: relative to parent
* BPMN: absolute

--> required a transformation layer
