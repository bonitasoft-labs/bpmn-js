=== mxGraph Integration

The https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/[mxGraph] integration is in charge of displaying the BPMN diagrams, by filling the
https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/manual.html#3.1.1:[mxGraph model] from the BPMN model and the mxGraph BPMN styles.

The lib defines the mxGraph BPMN styles and associates them to the right render, using dedicated BPMN mxGraph shapes.
